Sneaker Room

In this project we are creating a website for sneaker heads. You can search for any sneaker brand ( Nike, Adidas, Reebok, ect. ) and create an account where you can store all the shoes in a wishlist; by clicking on your shoe you can have the option to delete, share or buy it in any website. On the page a newsfeed will let you see other members from the website sort of like a community. In addition it will have the option to review the shoe and get the name, price and year of the shoe. we get the data by scraping other website because we couldn't find a free API shoes for this project .
